# Express Server Introduction

Welcome to our Express server, a robust and flexible framework for building server-side applications. Express stands out for its simplicity, performance, and scalability, making it an ideal choice for developing efficient and maintainable web applications.

## Server Structure

Our server is designed with a focus on modularity and scalability, leveraging the power of Express to handle HTTP requests and responses with ease. The server is structured around a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach, which organizes the codebase into distinct domains, each representing a specific business capability. This structure enhances maintainability and scalability, allowing for easy expansion and modification as the application grows.

### Database Management

We utilize MongoDB Atlas as our database, a highly scalable and flexible NoSQL database that supports a wide range of data models and querying capabilities. To interact with MongoDB, we employ Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library that provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model our application data. Mongoose simplifies the process of working with MongoDB, offering features such as validation, query building, and middleware support.

### Caching and Rate Limiting

To improve performance and protect our server from abuse, we integrate Redis through Upstash for caching and rate limiting. Redis is an in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker. By leveraging Redis for rate limiting, we can effectively control the number of requests a client can make to our server within a certain timeframe, thereby preventing abuse and ensuring fair usage.

### Security and Logging

Security is a critical aspect of any web application, and we take it seriously by using Helmet, a middleware that helps secure Express apps by setting various HTTP headers. Helmet is easy to use and can be configured to mitigate common web vulnerabilities.

For logging, we employ Pino, a fast and low-overhead JSON logger, with a custom setup that prefixes logs for different services, databases, Redis, and routes. This setup ensures that our logs are clear, concise, and easy to analyze, providing valuable insights into the application's behavior and performance.

### Authentication and Authorization

Our server implements JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and authorization, supporting both access and refresh tokens. JWTs are a secure and efficient way to manage user sessions and permissions, allowing us to verify the identity of users and control access to protected resources.

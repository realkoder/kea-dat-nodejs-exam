# Svelte Application Introduction

Welcome to our Svelte application, a modern and efficient framework for building web applications. Svelte stands out for its unique approach to web development, offering a refreshing alternative to traditional frameworks by shifting the heavy lifting from the client to the build step. This results in highly optimized and performant applications with a minimal footprint.

The decision to use Svelte over SvelteKit is deliberate and stems from the desire to embrace Svelte's core features without the additional abstractions and conventions introduced by SvelteKit. By doing so, we aim to maintain a lean and focused codebase, providing full control over the project structure and build process. This approach allows us to tailor the application to our specific needs while leveraging the inherent simplicity and efficiency of Svelte.

Svelte's reactivity model and component-based architecture enable developers to write elegant and concise code, fostering rapid development without compromising on performance. The framework's emphasis on simplicity and directness empowers us to create modern web applications with minimal overhead and maximum impact.

In summary, our choice to use Svelte reflects our commitment to harnessing the full potential of this innovative framework, enabling us to deliver a web application that is not only powerful and feature-rich but also optimized for speed and efficiency.

## Client structure

### Implementation Details

#### Shadcn-svelte for Pre-made Components

We have integrated shadcn-svelte to leverage its pre-made components, allowing us to expedite development by utilizing a collection of ready-to-use UI elements and widgets. This not only accelerates the development process but also ensures consistency and coherence in the user interface.

#### TailwindCSS

Our project harnesses the power of TailwindCSS, a utility-first CSS framework, to streamline the styling process. By utilizing its extensive set of utility classes, we are able to rapidly build and customize our UI components, resulting in a consistent and visually appealing user interface.

#### Eslint Svelte Plugin

To maintain code quality and consistency, we have incorporated the Eslint Svelte plugin into our development workflow. This plugin enforces best practices, identifies potential issues, and ensures adherence to coding standards, thereby enhancing the overall codebase quality.

#### Prettier

In addition to Eslint, we have integrated Prettier to automatically format our code, ensuring a uniform and standardized code style across the project. This not only improves code readability but also reduces the time spent on manual formatting, allowing us to focus on writing high-quality code.
